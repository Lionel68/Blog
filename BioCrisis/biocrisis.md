# Biodiversity in crisis

## Paper list

- [Vellend 2013 PNAS](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/48/19456.short): litterature review of changes in plant communities at local scale (less than 5ha for forest and less than 1ha for grassland), from nonexperimental plots, sampled for at least two points in time spaced by more than 5yrs, 148 papers. Responses as LRR, LRR did not diverge from 0, on average no directional changes in local plant richness, so the link between richness and function reported in experimental BEF studies cannot be applied to nonexperimental system where richness is not declining at the local scale. Importance to study compositional shifts and diversity increase effects on ecosystem functions.

- [Gonzalez 2016 Ecology](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/15-1759.1): 3 main critics of Vellend2013 and Dornelas2014: (i) studies included in the analysis are not respresentatives of global diversity and human impacts on natural systems, (ii) study duration impacts conclusions with shorter studies making it harder to detect effects, (iii) use of inappropriate baseline in the original papers bias the conclusions

- [Vellend 2017 Ecology](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.1660): responded in turn to all critiques from Gonzalez 2016, (i) effect of geographical bias affect all ecological meta-nalaysis including those that show results going more into the directions of what the authors think, (ii) study duration impacts emerge from 2 mistakes in the simulations, (iii) the effect of recovery shown in Gonzalez was dependent on the weighting of the log ratios by the sample size of the study, in addition they argued that disturbances do no always lead to diversity decline in the short-term all kind of relations were reported (see Supp paper).

- [Hillebrand 2017 Applied Ecology](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.12959): species richness or other univariates diversity metrics (simpson, shannon) are poor metrics to track biodiversity changes as they provide little information on the dynamics at play (this is not something new), showed in three different datasets large shifts in community composition of primary producers despite constant richness / simpson, propose a new metric to track biodiversity, assessing decline in biodiversity cannot be done by looking at temporal trends in richness. The authors do miss the essence of the argument of Vellend against richness-based BEF namely that diversity protection on ground that it provides larger local functioning does not hold since at local scales richness is not declining. This does not hinder the scientific value of the exercise rather its applied usefulness.

- [Cardinale 2018 BioCons](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071732089X): data collated by Vellend and Dornelas are not representatives of biodiversity dynamics globally, they aggregate dynamics driven by different drivers and at different stages of the dynamic, by failing to set a baseline the criticed papers are very much affected by the beginning of the time-serie, yet little information available to set benchmarks from most historical datasets combine these with paleobiology infos ... biotic homogeneisation make sense if combined with knowledge of native / non-native species dynamics, they argue for creating datasets recording diversity under different land-use change scenarios comparing impacted and reference sites, interesting Box1
