## Aim 

Simulate datasets and test the sensitivity of piecewiseSEM and lavaan to variation in sample sizes, number of variables, number of paths and correctedness of the fitted models.

## Status

First graphs done with randomly generated data and tested both in piecewiseSEM and in lavaan

## next Steps

* Test for larger sample sizes and more or less connected graphs (varying C)
* Generate data following exactly the fitted relation
